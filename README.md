## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: You need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) is usually included with Node.js. You can verify the installation by running:
  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akanth24/weather-monitoring-backend.git
```
```bash
cd weather-monitoring-backend
```
### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Keys

Configure the OpenWeatherMap API key, MongoDB Atlas connection, and email service credentials in the ``` .env ``` file

### 4. Run the application
To run the backend server in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Description

#### Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring
The backend is responsible for real-time weather data retrieval, processing, and storing summaries in MongoDB Atlas. It allows users to set and manage custom alert thresholds for weather conditions, and sends email notifications when these thresholds are breached. Weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API at 5-minute intervals.

#### Features:

**Real-time Weather Data Retrieval:** Continuously fetches weather data for specified metro cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad) from the OpenWeatherMap API every 5 minutes.

**Data Processing and Conversion:** Converts temperature data from Kelvin to Celsius and stores weather data in MongoDB Atlas

**Rollups and Aggregates:**
- Provides daily weather summaries that include:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition (e.g., rain, clear skies, etc.)
  - Average Humidity
  - Average Wind Speed.
- Summaries are stored in MongoDB Atlas for future analysis.

**User-Configurable Alerts:**
- Users can create, edit, or delete alert thresholds based on weather conditions, such as temperature exceeding 35Â°C for two consecutive updates.
- Email notifications are sent when thresholds are breached, using Nodemailer.
